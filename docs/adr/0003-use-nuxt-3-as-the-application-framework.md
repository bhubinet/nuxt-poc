# 3. Use Nuxt 3 as the Application Framework

Date: 2025-05-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need an SSR-capable framework for Vue 3 that supports modularity and modern development patterns.

## Decision

We choose Nuxt 3 due to its Vite integration, file-based routing, and strong ecosystem.

## Consequences

- Opinionated structure (beneficial for consistency)
- Learning curve for Nuxt-specific conventions
