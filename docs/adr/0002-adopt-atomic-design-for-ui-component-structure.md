# 2. Adopt Atomic Design for UI Component Structure

Date: 2025-05-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want a clear, scalable, and reusable component system for building complex UIs collaboratively.

## Decision

We'll use the Atomic Design methodology (Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, Pages). Components will be organized into folders accordingly.

## Consequences

- Better collaboration and modularity
- Slightly more complex folder hierarchy
- All developers must follow naming conventions
